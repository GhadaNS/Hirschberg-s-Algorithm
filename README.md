# Code source Structure 
The Program consists of 3 parts: the Main **(Hirschberg.py)**, and 2 modules: the hb  **(Hirschberg) class (hb.py)**, and the **nmw (Needleman-Wunsch) class (nmw.py)**

- **The hb class:** For the creation of “hb” objects, after which we call its Hirschberg method  to create the list of aligned sequences. 
- **The nmw class:** For the creation of “nmw” objects, after which we call its  EnumerateAlignments method to create the list of aligned sequences.
- **The main:** The starting point of the program’s execution. Results in both the Needleman Wunsch and Hirschberg Alignment.
